# PseudoWoodo

This is an extension/application that is designed to accept pseudocode, query a search engine, then display recommendations based on the user's input.

This idea developed out of frustration while learning how to code. I thought of what I would have liked to have been available when I was just starting to learn, and this was what I came up with; a tool that would help people learn syntax, best practices, other techniques while they code, all without leaving the editor window.
