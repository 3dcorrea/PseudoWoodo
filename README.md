# PseudoWoodo

This is an extension/application that is designed to accept pseudocode, query a search engine, then display recommendations based on the user's input.

This idea developed out of a need to learn/teach myself how to code. I thought of what I would have liked to have been available when I was learning, and this was what I came up with; a tool that would help me learn syntax/BP/other techniques while I coded, without leaving the editor window.
